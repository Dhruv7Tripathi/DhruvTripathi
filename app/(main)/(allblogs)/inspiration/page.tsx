        Lord Hanuman, the epitome of devotion, strength, and unwavering faith, has always been a source of inspiration in my life. His qualities of humility, dedication, and courage resonate deeply with me, influencing the way I approach challenges, personal growth, and spirituality.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Devotion and Commitmentn</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Hanuman's unwavering devotion to Lord Rama teaches me the importance of loyalty and commitment. Whether it is towards my work, relationships, or personal goals, his example inspires me to stay dedicated and persistent. His selfless service reminds me that true success lies in giving my best without expecting immediate rewards.    </p>

        Moore's Law—the observation that computing power doubles approximately every two years—has held remarkably true, driving innovations across fields from medicine to entertainment, transportation to communication. This acceleration means that the technological landscape can transform dramatically in just a few years, constantly reshaping how we live, work, and connect.
      </p> */}

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Fearlessness and Strength</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Despite facing numerous challenges, Hanuman never backed down. His leap across the ocean to Lanka symbolizes courage, determination, and an unshakable belief in one’s abilities. Whenever I face obstacles in life, I remind myself of Hanuman’s fearless attitude and push forward with confidence.      </p>

        A teenager in a remote village can now build an app that reaches millions. A passionate educator can create online courses that students across the globe can access. A patient with a rare condition can connect with specialists and others sharing their experience from continents away. Technology, at its best, breaks down barriers and creates opportunities that were once reserved for the privileged few.
      </p> */}

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Humility and Wisdom</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Even with immense strength and intelligence, Hanuman remained humble. He never sought personal glory but always acted in service of others. This teaches me the value of humility and the importance of using knowledge and skills for the greater good rather than personal gain.      </p>

        The potential impact of advanced AI systems on society could rival that of electricity or the internet. Machines that can diagnose diseases, optimize energy usage, accelerate scientific research, and augment human creativity are not science fiction but emerging realities. As these technologies evolve, they promise to address some of humanity's most pressing challenges while raising important questions about the future of work, privacy, and human uniqueness.
